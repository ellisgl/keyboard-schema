# keyboard-schema
JSON Schema definitions for Mechanical Keyboard Layouts. Think KLE (Keyboard Layout Editor (Keyboard-Layout-Editor.com)) stuff, but to make something better? 

This is a WIP (Work In Progress) and currently working on / need help with:
* Documentation in the schema.
* More stuff in the schema.
* Breaking out schemas.
* More schemas?
